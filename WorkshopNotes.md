__Programming Practices__
Accessibility
We want to encourage good programming practices that. To make your website appealing to a variety of users, you should follow some compliance guidelines.
1. Article with an easy-to-understand list of ADA compliance website issues (I recommend you skip to the issues): https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/ada-compliance-website/
2. Check for at least 4.5:1 ratio of color contrast: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
3. Having good alternative text and titles for links is important
