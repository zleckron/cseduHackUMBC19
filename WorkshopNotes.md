__We're doing everything fast, here are the notes__
- Download Sublime3: [sublime.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- Download Sublime Merge (for Git): [sublimemerge.com] (https://www.sublimemerge.com/)

__In Sublime__
- Make a file and save it as `index.html` (the "index" part of the name is not very significant but the html file extension is)
HTML shortcuts in Sublime
1. Auto Tags: With your saved .html file open, type `!` then hit tab to add standard HTML tags automatically
2. Comments: use `Cmd-/` to comment out the current line
3. Link your JavaScript file: type `<sc` then tab. Edit "text/javascript" to the _relative_ path to your .js file (see below). I called mine `script.js`

- File > New or Cmd-N to make a new file, save it to .js (JavaScript)
JavaScript shortcuts in Sublime
1. type 'fun' and hit tab to demo the syntax of a function

__Programming Practices__
Accessibility
We want to encourage good programming practices that. To make your website appealing to a variety of users, you should follow some compliance guidelines.
1. Article with an easy-to-understand list of ADA compliance website issues (I recommend you skip to the issues): https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/ada-compliance-website/
2. Check for at least 4.5:1 ratio of color contrast: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
3. Having good alternative text and titles for links is important
